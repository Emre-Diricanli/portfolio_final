# Portfolio Performance Optimizations

## Key Performance Improvements

1. **Icon System Optimization**
   - Split large icons.tsx file (822KB) into modular components
   - Created `components/icons/` folder for individual icon files
   - Implemented index file for icons to maintain API compatibility

2. **Component Memoization**
   - Applied React.memo to components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Memoized static elements within components
   - Implemented useCallback for event handlers

3. **Animation Optimization**
   - Pre-defined animation variants to reduce object creation during render
   - Implemented motion.div with reusable animation configs

4. **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading**
   - Used Next.js dynamic imports for heavy components
   - Implemented conditional rendering based on device size
   - Configured proper loading states for lazy-loaded components

5. **Globe Component Optimization**
   - Improved useEffect dependency array
   - Memoized event handlers with useCallback
   - Used useRef for values that don't trigger re-renders
   - Added proper cleanup for event listeners

6. **Codebase Cleanup**
   - Removed unused components:
     - theme-provider.tsx
     - signup-form-demo.tsx
     - container-scroll-animation.tsx
     - layout-grid.tsx
     - Old "Look 1" components (About.tsx, Techstack.tsx, Contact.tsx, Projects.tsx)
   - Removed unused packages:
     - @tabler/icons-react
     - radix-ui (redundant with @radix-ui/* packages)
     - @radix-ui/react-accordion
   - Cleaned up unused imports in app/page.tsx
