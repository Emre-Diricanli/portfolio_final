# Portfolio Performance Optimizations

## Implemented Optimizations

### Next.js Configuration
- Added `swcMinify: true` for better JS minification
- Set `poweredByHeader: false` to remove unnecessary headers
- Added image optimization with `quality: 80`
- Added console removal in production build
- Implemented bundle analyzer for dependency analysis

### Component Optimization
- Converted monolithic icons.tsx (822KB) to modular, separate icon files
- Implemented lazy loading of icons with dynamic imports and placeholders
- Added viewport-based lazy loading for the Globe component
- Dynamically imported non-critical UI components (ScrollToTop, Dock)
- Deferred Google Analytics loading with `strategy="afterInteractive"`

### Device-Specific Optimizations
- Added device detection for Globe component
- Reduced quality parameters for mobile devices:
  - Decreased marker count
  - Lowered devicePixelRatio
  - Reduced map sample count
  - Optimized canvas dimensions

### Development Workflow Improvements
- Added TypeScript typechecking script (`npm run typecheck`)
- Added bundle analyzer script (`npm run analyze`)
- Created production build pipeline with pre-flight checks
- Added Lighthouse integration for performance monitoring

## Measured Improvements

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Initial Load JS | Large monolithic bundle | Multiple smaller chunks |
| Time to Interactive | Delayed by large JS | Improved with code splitting |
| Mobile Performance | Same code as desktop | Device-optimized rendering |
| Build Size | Unoptimized | Reduced with better minification |

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Image Optimization**
   - Further optimize images using next/image with proper sizing
   - Consider using modern image formats like AVIF for better compression

2. **Server Components**
   - Consider converting non-interactive sections to React Server Components
   - Use streaming for large content areas

3. **Fonts**
   - Consider using variable fonts to reduce font file size
   - Implement font-display strategies for text visibility during font loading

4. **API Performance**
   - Implement SWR or React Query for data fetching with caching
   - Add response caching for external APIs

5. **CSS Optimization**
   - Implement critical CSS extraction
   - Remove unused CSS with PurgeCSS

To analyze performance further, run:
```bash
npm run analyze
```

To test overall performance metrics:
```bash
npm run lighthouse
```
